He provides a self accountable environment that allows dancers of any level to bravely grow into their best through foundation training, movement exploration, and choreography. His joy as a mentor comes from seeing his students grow into the best versions of themselves while they are training with him. Although Casa is a well rounded, versatile dancer, he focuses on teaching mainly Jazz and Hip Hop (all varieties), and also includes Lyrical and Contemporary. While holding students accountable for their own growth, he also nurtures and supports them, in every class.
